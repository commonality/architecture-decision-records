#   uncomment this line to change the approval pattern to "lgtm" at the beginning of the comment
#   pattern: "^lgtm"

#   by default, every pull request requires two approvals
#   uncomment this line to change it to three
#   minimum: 3

#   uncomment this line to ignore approvals from the pull request opener

#   ignore: pr_opener

#   by default, zappr counts everyone as a valid approver
